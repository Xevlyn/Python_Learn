# complex data type for complex numbers
# used mostly in complex math functions and programs that use it
# the function bin returns the binary representation of the integers

#Basically these are number conversions
#ob at the beginning  of it is not part of the actual conversions
#To remove the ob use format (num, 'b')

print(bin(5)) #lookup the documentation
print(int('0b101', 2)) #Converts the binary number into an integer

print(4 / 2 + 1 * 4 - 4)
