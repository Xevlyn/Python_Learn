#Fundamental Data types

#Integer is a number example 1,2,3,4,5
#Float is a floating point number or a number which is a decimal example 0.5,0.2
#Float takes more space in memory as compared to the interger 
#Can be used in mathematical situations 
print(type(2 + 4)) #type tells us what data type the output is here
print(type(2 * 4))
print(type(2 / 4))
print(type(2 - 4))

print(2 ** 2) #to the power of
print(10 // 7) #returns nad interger rounded down
print(2 % 4) #modulo is used to represent whats the remainder of the divivsion
