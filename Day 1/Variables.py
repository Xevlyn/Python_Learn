# Variables store information which can be used in the program such as values, names, DoS
# Programs are data which are being; stored, changed and removed

# IQ program example

user_iq = 190 #IQ  is a variable which 190 has been assigned to
iq = user_iq/4
a = iq

print(a)


b,c,d = 3,5,7
print(b,c,d)



#Best Practices
# 1. Snake_case where by all are lowercase and  underscores
# 2. Starts with lowercase or underscore
# 3. Letter, numbers, underscores
# 4. Case sensitive
# 5. Don't overwrite keywords


# Constants in programs don't change and they are written mostly in capital
# Dunder ( __ ) ie double underscore, should not be changed
