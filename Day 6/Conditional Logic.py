# In conditional logic , Booleans are very important


is_old = False
is_licenced = True

#Now from what I understand here, when ever a condition is checked its to make sure that first of all its true then otherwise
# Even if the conditional has already been assigned to a particular value the condition above is checked and
# ie is the condition True or is the condition False

# An expresion is something that produces a new value

# the elif statement is useful  in that multiple conditions can be written with the elif
