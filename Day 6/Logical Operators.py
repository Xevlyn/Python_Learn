# AND, OR, NOT.
# >, <, ==, =,>=, <=, !=

# For most programming languages the equal signs is ==
# and this is bcs the = is used to assign values hence making it a keyword.

# Google this to find out
# .
# print('a' >'b') FALSE
#   Its false bcs the value a is 97 decimal and b is 98 decimal hence is higher thus the output false
# .
# 
# print('a'>'A') TRUE
#   Its True bcs the value a is 97 and the value A which is capitalized as can be seen is 65 thus the output false since 97 > 65
# 
# All of these are according the ASCII
# a = 97 decimal
# b = 98 decimal
# A = 65 decimal
# B = 66 decimal.
