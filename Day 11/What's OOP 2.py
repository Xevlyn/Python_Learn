# History of code from machine code to high-level code and the origin of Object oriented code.

# Before, what was available was procedural code which goes from top to bottom then compiles

# In python you can create your own class with the class keyword and camel casing is used.

# A class in OOP is  a blue print of what we want to create wc includes the basic attributes it has and the basic actions which it can take.

# Instantiate means an instance was created.


class BigObject:  # class
    # Stored in memory
    pass
# Meaning when another Object is created, the editor goes to the memory and checks for where the code was stored and run the code hence keeping the code dry.


obj1 = BigObject()  # class being instantiated
obj2 = BigObject()
obj3 = BigObject()


print(type(obj1))
