    # Methods are owned by the string
    # Methods are built in objects that have methods such as strings, dictionaries, sets, topples etc which own them ie 'Franky'.capitalize() where Franky is the string which owns the method capitalize

# Both methods and functions allow us to take actions on our datatypes with minimal differences ie one has a a dot- method and the other doesn't - function
