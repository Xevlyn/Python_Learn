# A very good programmer is one that can decide on what data structure to chose and when
# 
# When should we use a list and when should we use a dictionary
# Dictionaries are not ordered where as lists are with zero one indexes
# Dictionaries hold more information than list since list have just a single value.
# Dictionaries hold values based on keys and values which holds more information
# While lists have simple just indexes which don't as much as the dictionary does.
